        <p class="paragraph stg-E1"> Today, taking a specific car in picture, one can say that 70% of the cost goes
            towards
            electronic components and the rest goes to non electronic parts such as body, powertrain etc. Electronics
            and Computer Engineers will be responsible for design and development of all the Low Voltage Components like
            PCB, Arduino, DAQ, and driver interface. It's a cross-functional and multidisciplinary department which
            focuses mainly on information & data tracking as well as simplifying the tasks. Apart from this, the team is
            constantly working on implementing autonomous driving into the vehicle. </p>
