        <p class="paragraph stg-E1">The Mechanical Engineering team designs and manufactures the entire mechanical
            system of the car including the suspension, steering, chassis, gearbox and braking systems. They
            account for the ballast and weight distribution when making all of their design decisions. They are also the
            "jack-of-all-trades," balancing all the needs of other subsystems. Electrical team needs a place to mount
            the
            battery? No problem - we got that covered.</p>
