                <p class="stg1">We are Team Achillius - a student group under St Joseph Engineering College, Mangalore.  Every year, we design and 
                    manufacture a solar powered electric vehicle that competes in prestigious national level competitions.</p>

                <p class="stg1">Our proud team is an embodiment of diversity across disciplines as we bring together hardworking, dynamic 
                    minded individuals that are ready to undergo an intense experience solving real world engineering challenges every day.

                <p class="stg1">Team Achillius was started in 2017 as the first of its kind in Mangalore. Since then, we have successfully built TWO
                     electric solar vehicles and won many accolades. Our main event is the
                     <a href="https://esvc.in/" target="__blank"> Electric Solar Vehicle Championship which is </a>

                    and was the first of its kind.
