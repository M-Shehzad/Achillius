                <p class="stg1">We are Team Achillius - a student group under <a href="https://www.sjec.ac.in" target="__blank">St Joseph
                        Engineering College, Mangalore</a>. Every year, we design and manufacture a solar powered
                    electric vehicle that competes in prestigious national level competitions. Students from multiple
                    departments come together and get an intense experience as they undergo real world engineering
                    challenges everyday. Apart from technical aspects, members gain invaluable business and project
                    management skills.
                </p>
                <p class="stg1">Team Achillius was started in 2017 as the first of its kind in Mangalore. Since then,
                    we have successfully built TWO electric solar vehicles and won many accolades. Our main event is the
                    <a href="https://esvc.in/" target="__blank">Electric Solar Vehicle Championship</a> which is organised by <a

                <p>From the urges of new technology for a convenient mode of travel, there was a birth of an idea named
                    Raptor. Powered by the sun and (Li-ion batteries), it was a four-wheeled fully electric automobile
                    and was the first of its kind.
